P3 keeps 99.\n3. **If P1, P2, P3, P4 remain**: P4 needs two votes (including their own). They give 1 coin to P2 (who gets nothing if P4 dies) and 1 coin to P4, keeping 98.\n4. **With all 5 pirates (P1-P5)**: The proposer (P5) needs two additional votes. They secure P3 and P1 by giving them 1 coin each (P3 gets nothing if P5 dies, and P1 gets nothing if P5 dies). P5 keeps 97.\n\nThus, the smartest pirate (P5) proposes: **P1: 1, P2: 0, P3: 1, P4: 0, P5: 98**. Wait, no\u2014actually, revisiting the logic, the correct proposal is **P5: 97, P3: 1, P1: 2** (or similar variations), but the standard answer for the proposer's share is **97**.\n\nHowever, the options provided seem to imply a simpler or alternate interpretation (e.g., fewer pirates or modified rules). Given the classic 5-pirate setup, the proposer keeps **97**, but if the question assumes fewer pirates or different rules, the answer might vary. \n\nGiven the options, **B. 97** is the most plausible correct answer based on standard pirate game theory. \n\n**Answer: B**",
